## IMPROVEMENTS

When our team took over the project from the previous group, we thoroughly reviewed the project in order to establish an effective takeover strategy. We attempted to improve the project in as many ways as possible. We've detailed the enhancements we've made in this document.

* UI Enhancement:
The UI for the previous application was very basic and not very appealing. With the help of Material UI we were able to enhance the UI by leaps and bounds.

* Resume Builder:
We added a resume builder feature which will enable the users to generate a resume in a word file without getting worried about formatting the document. The user input the values in the required fields and can download the resume.

* Cover Letter Generator:
Using the latest ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo OpenAI API , we were able to generate a cover letter for a particular job role and company taken as input from the user. The user can then download the cover letter from our website.

* Interactive ChatBot:
We implemented a ChatBot using OpenAI API which will be a great aid for candidates searching for a job and can be used to answer queries quickly.

* Application reminder:
It sets an application reminder notifications for the applications currently present in the wishlist applications.

* Dashboard:
Created a personal dashboard for the user to keep a track of all the applications and display the count through a bargraph.
